I couldn't be more productive today as I was distracted a lot.
        I need to control my thoughts and live more in the present.
Control bad thoughts. Do something every day, distract yourself with a new good habit, no peeking.
I am going to take the example of Marcus Aurelius the greatest Emporer who is going to stay in control no matter the situation
and thoughts. I am going to take responsibility for my life and I am going to be more in control of my life    
I am going to be more sober and thus increase my AURA and stay in the best possible shape.
Groom nicely.

I am extraordinary.
I need to work more on my self control. I need to be more productive.
Somedays I feel bad and nervous. Hence I need to increase my confidence and you know what I should do for that.
So just align your habits perfectly for that.
I am going to have a proper schedule. No phone upto 1hr of waking up and then
immediate workout.
If possible try to wake up before 7 am on days you dont go to office.
You are perfectly healthy so just be fine with your thoughts.
Stay conscious of your breathing and enjoy everything.
Work on your websit 30 mins per day. Daily learning 1.5 hrs.
Office work try to wrap up in 4 hrs everyday with Deep Work(its not possible but try)
