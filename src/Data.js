I couldn't be more productive today as I was distracted a lot.
        I need to control my thoughts and live more in the present.
Control bad thoughts. Do something every day, distract yourself with a new good habit, no peeking.
I am going to take the example of Marcus Aurelius the greatest Emporer who is going to stay in control no matter the situation
and thoughts. I am going to take responsibility for my life and I am going to be more in control of my life    
I am going to be more sober and thus increase my AURA and stay in the best possible shape.
Groom nicely.
