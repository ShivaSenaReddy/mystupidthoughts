    Description: `I booked only Puse 7 for 2hrs from 2:30 to 4:30 assuming it will be available
    at 4:30. It wasnt and people were dissapointed by my choice.
Coming to my batting, when defend the ball is sometimes in the air which can be caught.
So on Monday I am going to hit the ball cleanly. and defend cleanly.
Few of my sixes were too low and they can be caught easily.
I will hit sixes above the feilder's reach on Monday.
I am going to hold the bat with tight grip. Play with intent and am going to smash the bowlers at will for sixes.
Try to use more depth in crease and also stance check while batting.`

    Description: `Today I was nervous before the game. My hands were shaking but I know that
when I am like this I am game on. Went to bat at the non-striker end.Akhil scored a 4.
That eased pressure on us and I got off the mark quickly with a single. 2nd over Akhil got out.
3rd Over I faced the first ball. Was beaten by pace short ball. After getting beaten again, I moved deep into the crease and smoked two 6s with ease.
Tried to go for one more but hit it the roof. I am really happy the way our team executed our plans.
Jagadeesh's 4 was superb and he eased pressure calmly. Need to keep continuing like this. Great bowling execution and tight fielding.
I was able to score easily.`

    Description: `My batting was not upto the mark today because I was trying to hit 6
every ball and no singles. It happened before with badminton where I evolved my game
and pushed it so that I can hit gracefully. I lost so many games in this process but today my game
is on another level because of that.
We lost 0-8 today but I know on Tuesday, I will score runs and I will hit the ball cleanly.
We are going to win on Tuesday.`

I couldn't be more productive today as I was distracted a lot.
        I need to control my thoughts and live more in the present.
Control bad thoughts. Do something every day, distract yourself with a new good habit, no peeking.
I am going to take the example of Marcus Aurelius the greatest Emporer who is going to stay in control no matter the situation
and thoughts. I am going to take responsibility for my life and I am going to be more in control of my life    
I am going to be more sober and thus increase my AURA and stay in the best possible shape.
Groom nicely. This happened because I am not getting more things done. I am stuck with two SRs
and I have a dental appointment today and I am worried about it.
